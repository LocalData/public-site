          <h2>Mapping the nighttime economy</h2>
          <p>A group of graduate students at the Harvard University Graduate
          School of Design Planning School collected data on Malden,
          Massachusett's streets at night for a core planning studio last
          Spring. The audit was performed to help understand where people
          gather, how well streets were lit and how isolated walking routes
          are.</p>

          <h2>In action</h2>
          <p>The data was used to produce maps and statistical data to inform a
          larger planning document for the City called "Plan Downtown Malden."
          The resulting plan used data collected by the students using
          LocalData's platform and combined this spatial information with
          hundreds of in-person interviews. The plan aims at improving
          accessibility and circulation downtown to foster economic growth and
          create a regional destination.</p>
