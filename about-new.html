          <h2>LocalData is a digital toolkit to help modernize community- led data collection of place-based information.</h2>

          <p>Across the country, community groups, planners and government agencies collect parcel-level information about communities. Typically, the process for collecting, transcribing and cleaning this data can be confusing, lengthy and disempowering. LocalData transforms this process with technology.</p>

          <p>LocalData began as a 2012 Code for America project with the City of Detroit. Three Code for America fellows (Matt, Alicia and Prashant) identified a need for local data in Detroit. Though community groups were actively surveying neighborhoods and using this data â€” neighborhood level surveys took a long time and further stressed the under-resourced technical assistance providers that were assisting this effort. Additionally, comprehensive city-wide surveys were taken infrequently, often involving multiple partners, with months of surveying and transcription.</p>

          <h2>Made for collaboration</h2>
          <p>Have  one data collector or hundreds of people going out in the
            field? We've got you covered. We don't limit you by number of data collectors,
            which makes LocalData great </p>
          <p><a href="#">See how Gary, Indiana used volunteer events to
            collect the data they needed</a></p>

          <h2>Built on a solid base</h2>
          <p>No more looking up addresses or entering in property ID numbers.
          Save time by using parcel boundaries, building footprints,
          and any other official data you already have.</p>

          <h2>Mobile first</h2>
          <p>Take the phones and tablets you already own out in the field. We've designed    LocalData's data collection app to work great on
            a wide variety of smartphones. Have bad connectivity? You can even
            go offline for extended periods. The app knows when you've reconnected
            and automatically syncs the data.</p>

          <h2>Share your data</h2>
          <p>Our tools make it easy to get your data in the format you need.
            Quickly transfer information between departments and keep stakeholders
            informed by sharing access. We can also help design custom solutions
            for making your data a community resource.</p>

          <h2>Nothing to download</h2>
          <p>With LocalData, there's no software to download. You can securely
            access your data in the cloud from work, on the road, and at home.
            Your data collectors don't need to install anything, either -- skip

          <p>The tech LocalData continues to be an open source project. Our code is on GitHub. The mobile app is built on HTML5, JavaScript, and Leaflet, and the backend uses Node.js, MongoDB, and PostGIS. We're working to make the project better and more reusable, and would love your contributions and ideas.</p>
