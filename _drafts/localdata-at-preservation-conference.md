If you're attending the [National Preservation Conference](http://www.preservationnation.org/resources/training/npc/) next week, don't miss LocalData CTO Prashant Singh in the *Survey Slam* panel Thursday morning. The panelists will present successful historic preservation survey techniques and technologies and discuss the state of the art.

LocalData has been used to pull historic building indicators into the neighborhood revitalization effort, as well for other data-driven practices. We'll explain the principles that guide our development of LocalData and why those principles are important to modern planning and preservation work. And then, of course, we'll demo!
