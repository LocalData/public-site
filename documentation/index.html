<p>The Detroit Commercial Land Inventory City Study (CLICS) conducted a comprehensive survey of commercial land in the City of Detroit to document the use, condition, and design of approximately one third of all commercially zoned parcels in the city. This was the first study of its kind in twenty-eight years.</p>

<p><strong>The problem:</strong> A significant lack of data on the land use and condition of commercial parcels in the city required better data. Inconsistencies between zoning and reality prevented decisionmakers from making an informed analysis.</p>

<p>The University-Public partnership turned to the LocalData team to
 make the process fast and accurate. Instead of spending weeks transcribing
 paper forms, student teams were able to use their smartphones to
 quickly collect data in the field and transform it into actionable information</p>

 <p class="quote">"This was the first study of its kind conducted at this scale in twenty-eight years."</p>

<p>CLICs decided to focus on specific corridors in Detroit identified by the planning department and Detroit Works including areas zoned as commercial, Main Street overlay areas, major corridors, thoroughfares, and Detroit Works Project demonstration areas of targeted investment and economic development. LocalData
integrated the city's parcel data to make sure that records were accurate
and give survey teams on-the-ground context.</p>

<h2>Collaboration is key</h2>
<p>Survey team managers used LocalData's web-based dashboard to easily
view the results from work or home. Survey groups large and small
were free to collect data without worrying about license restrictions.</p>
