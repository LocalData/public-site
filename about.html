          <h2>LocalData is a digital toolkit to help modernize community- led data collection of place-based information.</h2>

          <p>Across the country, community groups, planners and government agencies collect parcel-level information about communities. Typically, the process for collecting, transcribing and cleaning this data can be confusing, lengthy and disempowering. LocalData transforms this process with technology.</p>

          <p>LocalData began as a 2012 Code for America project with the City of Detroit. Three Code for America fellows (Matt, Alicia and Prashant) identified a need for local data in Detroit. Though community groups were actively surveying neighborhoods and using this data â€” neighborhood level surveys took a long time and further stressed the under-resourced technical assistance providers that were assisting this effort. Additionally, comprehensive city-wide surveys were taken infrequently, often involving multiple partners, with months of surveying and transcription.</p>

          <h2>The tech</h2>

          <p>LocalData continues to be an open source project. Our code is on GitHub. The mobile app is built on HTML5, JavaScript, and Leaflet, and the backend uses Node.js, MongoDB, and PostGIS. We're working to make the project better and more reusable, and would love your contributions and ideas.</p>
