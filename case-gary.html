          <h2>Fighting blight with data</h2>
          <p>The Gary-Harris Initiative was formed in partnership between the
          City of Chicago's former Mayor Richard M. Daley, Gary's current Mayor
          Karen Freeman-Wilson and the University of Chicago's Harris School of
          Public Policy. Gary, Indiana is a city that like many smaller
          American communities experienced a drastic population decline from
          1960 - 2010. Thousands of abandoned or near-abandoned buildings
          require a $10-15k budget for a single demolition.</p>

          <p>Though the city recognized a need for redevelopment and
          revitalization, a significant lack of data was available on the
          condition and current ownership of abandoned properties. The best
          administrative datasets available from the Tax Assessor's office was
          out of date and didn't provide condition information about each
          property.</p>

          <h2>Results</h2>
          <p>With 67 volunteers, the team surveyed over 11,651 properties
          covering 2,000 acres across the city. Statistics were created to
          understanding both the spatial concentration of vacancy and
          abandonment, target areas for demolition or deconstruction and where
          the city should concentrate efforts to board up distressed
          housing.</p>
