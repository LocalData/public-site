            <p><strong>Personal Data:</strong> You may provide personal and organizational information, such as your name, email or the name of your organization. This may be used to contact you with additional product information and provide support. It will never be sold to a third party. </p>

            <p><strong>Survey Data:</strong> When you create a survey, we store information that includes the name of the survey, its geographic location, and the associated questions. When you submit a survey response, you submit information including the surveyor name, date, parcel location, and answers to questions about the location. </p>

            <p>LocalData currently shares this information publicly through our API. This means that others may see the results of your survey. This information helps local nonprofits and other organizations benefit from city-wide data. Some LocalData plans provide private surveys -- please contact us directly at <a href="mailto:info@localdata.com">info@localdata.com</a> for more details. </p>

            <p>LocalData should not be used to store information that is regulated, including personally identifiable health data, without consultation. Please contact us for more details.</p>

            <p><strong>Log Data:</strong> We use Google Analytics, KISSmetrics, and our own logging tools to record information ("Log Data") created by your use of the Services. Log Data may include information such as your IP address, browser type, operating system, the referring web page, pages visited, location, device and application IDs, search terms, and cookie information. We receive Log Data when you interact with our Services, for example, when you visit our websites. LocalData uses Log Data to measure, customize, and improve our services. It is never shared with third parties.</p>
